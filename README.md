## Overview  

The **40KG Forced Turbojet Engine** is a cutting-edge micro gas turbine producing **40 kilograms of thrust** in a compact form factor. Built on the principles of the Brayton cycle, it compresses, ignites, and expels air at extreme velocities to generate thrust.  

This project is the **first open-source initiative** making such a powerful engine accessible to developers, aerospace researchers, drone builders, and hobbyists worldwide.  

> **Why is this a big deal?**  
> - Lightweight but capable of lifting heavy platforms.  
> - Designed with modular, analyzable components.  
> - Includes safety documentation and ECU integration.  
> - Opens the door for innovation in UAVs, propulsion research, and experimental aerospace.

## How It Works ⚙️  

Like all turbojets, the 40KG engine follows the four-stage cycle:  

1. **Intake (Suck)** — Air is drawn in through the *Inlet Runner*.  
2. **Compression (Squeeze)** — The *Billet Wheel* and *Diffuser* compress the air.  
3. **Combustion (Bang)** — Injectors atomize fuel in the *Combustion Chamber*, ignited by a *Glow Plug*.  
4. **Exhaust (Blow)** — Superheated gases drive the *Turbine Wheel* and are expelled at high velocity through the *Exhaust Nozzle*.

## Safety & Responsibility ⚠️  

Operating turbines carries **significant risks**, including high temperatures (up to ~1000°C), high-speed rotating parts, toxic oil fumes, and acoustic hazards.  

Always follow:  
- Pre-operational safety checklists.  
- Use of fire extinguishers & protective equipment.  
- Strict distance rules for bystanders (≥20m).  
- Qualified ground assistants during startup.  

*This is not a beginner’s engine. Use responsibly. Read `ETHICS.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and the safety protocol in `DOCS/REFERENCE/` before any physical test.*
