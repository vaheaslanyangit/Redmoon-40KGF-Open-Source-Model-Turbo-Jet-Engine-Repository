# Contributing to the Redmoon 40KGF Open Source Turbojet

Thank you for your interest in advancing open, ethical propulsion technology. This guide explains how to propose changes, report issues, share data, and collaborate effectively.

## 1. Read First
Before contributing, familiarize yourself with:
- `INTRO.md` – project overview & goals
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` – behavioral expectations
- `ETHICS.md` – ethical use boundaries
- `COMMUNITY.md` – collaboration norms & decision process
- `Redmoon-40KGF-OPEN-SOURCE-MODEL/PARTS/PARTS.md` – component catalog

## 2. Contribution Types
| Type | Examples | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Documentation | Clarifications, diagrams, translations | Must be technically accurate |
| Design Improvements | Geometry refinements, tolerance analysis | Provide rationale & data |
| Safety Enhancements | Guards, failure analysis, risk mitigations | Mark PR with `safety` label |
| Performance Optimization | Combustion efficiency, flow smoothing | Show simulation or test evidence |
| Test Data | Thrust logs, fuel flow, EGT, RPM traces | Include instrumentation & conditions |
| Tooling / Scripts | Analysis utilities, validation scripts | Provide usage instructions |

## 3. Ethical & Legal Constraints
All contributions must comply with local laws, export controls, and the ethical restrictions in `ETHICS.md`. Do not submit controlled technical data or military-specific adaptations.

## 4. Workflow Overview
1. Open an Issue for any non-trivial change (design, structure, safety, performance).
2. Discuss approach; gather consensus if high impact.
3. Fork / branch: `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/combustor-dilution-v2`).
4. Implement + document.
5. Run checks / provide validation.
6. Open Pull Request (PR) referencing Issue ID.
7. Respond to review feedback promptly.
8. Squash or rebase if requested; maintain clean history.

## 5. Issue Reporting
Include: context, expected vs actual, reproduction steps, environment (tools, materials, test rig), and safety implications if any. Use labels where appropriate (`documentation`, `design-review`, `performance`, `safety`).

## 6. Pull Request Requirements
Each PR should include:
- Clear title (imperative mood)
- Linked Issue (if applicable)
- Summary of change & motivation
- Safety impact (explicitly state "None" if none)
- Validation evidence (simulation screenshots, CSV logs, calculations, photos)
- Backward compatibility notes
- Follow-up tasks (if deferring items)

### Validation Evidence Examples
| Change Type | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Combustor hole pattern | Temperature distribution sim + pattern factor calc |
| Turbine sleeve redesign | Runout measurement & balance analysis |
| Inlet smoothing | CFD pressure recovery vs baseline |
| Oil ring tweak | Oil flow rate before/after and bearing temp trend |

## 7. Coding / Documentation Standards
Even if this repo is design-heavy, keep consistency:
- Use Markdown for documentation; prefer relative paths for linking.
- Keep images in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `DOCS/SKETCHES/`).
- Use tables for tolerance & parameter summaries.
- Provide units (SI preferred) and define symbols.
- Avoid embedding large binary CAD in PR unless essential—reference external or add compressed neutral formats (STEP, IGES) with justification.

## 8. Data Submission Guidelines
| Field | Requirement |
|-------|------------|
| File Format | CSV or JSON preferred |
| Columns | Include time base, units row or doc section |
| Calibration | Note instrument model & calibration date if possible |
| Ambient Conditions | Pressure, temperature, humidity (if affecting performance) |
| Safety Notes | Any anomalies, excursions, shutdown causes |

## 9. Safety Considerations
Before testing or proposing high-energy modifications:
- Perform risk assessment (rotor containment, fuel handling, hot surfaces)
- Document emergency shutdown method
- NEVER test indoors without proper ventilation and fire mitigation equipment
- Log EGT, fuel flow, and RPM; do not exceed recommended spool thresholds

## 10. Review Expectations
Maintainers and reviewers will look for:
- Technical correctness & clarity
- Evidence-backed claims
- Alignment with ethics & safety
- Minimal scope creep
- Reusability and maintainability

## 11. Large or Breaking Changes
If your change affects multiple subsystems (e.g., combustor architecture, bearing system):
1. Create a design proposal Issue labeled `design-review`.
2. Provide diagrams, calculations, and risk analysis.
3. Allow at least 5 days for community feedback.
4. Incorporate consensus before implementation.

## 12. Attribution & Licensing
By contributing, you affirm you have the right to submit the content and agree it will be released under the project’s LICENSE. Cite third-party references properly. Do not copy proprietary manuals or controlled data.

## 13. Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Missing units or assumptions in calculations
- Unverified simulation meshes (no mesh independence study)
- Over-claiming performance without test backing
- Large, unfocused PRs mixing unrelated changes

## 14. Continuous Improvement Items (Good First Issues)
- Add missing tolerances to existing part docs
- Translate key docs into additional languages
- Provide structured test data templates
- Create analysis scripts for thrust normalization vs ambient conditions

## 15. Dispute Resolution
If PR feedback feels unclear or conflicting:
1. Summarize concerns factually.
2. Request a maintainer decision.
3. Final decision documented in PR thread.

## 16. Security / Misuse Reporting
Report suspected unethical use or re-hosting for prohibited applications via a confidential Issue or designated contact (see `ETHICS.md`). Provide evidence and context.

## 17. After Your PR is Merged
- Optionally add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS (planned section) with area of focus.
- Help review another open PR to pay it forward.
- Share summarized lessons learned if technical.

## 18. Questions?
Open an Issue labeled `question` or join ongoing design discussions. Polite curiosity is always welcome.
