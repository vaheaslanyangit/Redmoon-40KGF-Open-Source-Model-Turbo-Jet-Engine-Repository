# Project Roadmap – Redmoon 40KGF Open Source Turbojet

This roadmap lays out the structured path from the current repository state (sketches, preliminary parts list, governance docs) to a fully documented, reproducible, safely testable open-source turbine platform including mechanical CAD, firmware, ECU/ESU electronics, manufacturing instructions, validation data, and educational materials.

## 0. Current Status (Baseline)
| Domain | Status | Gaps |
|--------|--------|------|
| Sketches / Concept Imagery | ✅ Rich set in `DOCS/SKETCHES/` | Need dimensioned & toleranced CAD |
| Parts Catalog | ✅ `PARTS.md` functional descriptions | Missing BOM with qty, sourcing, cost |
| Manuals / Reference | Partial PDFs in `DOCS/REFERENCE/` | No unified build + test manual |
| Governance & Ethics | ✅ (Code of Conduct, Ethics, Contributing, Community) | Periodic review cadence not formalized |
| CAD Models | ❌ Not yet committed | Require parametric source + neutral exports |
| Firmware / ECU | ❌ Absent | Architecture, requirements, safety interlocks |
| Electronics (ESU/Control) | ❌ Not defined | Schematics, PCB, harness map |
| Test Data | ❌ None | Need validation framework & data format |
| Safety Protocol | Partial reference PDF | Formal hazard analysis & test checklist |
| Simulation (CFD/FEA) | ❌ None public | Need baseline aerodynamic & thermal models |
| Assembly Procedures | ❌ None | Step-by-step with torque specs & QA points |
| Compliance | ❌ Not addressed | Regulatory guidance (local airspace, noise) |

## 1. Guiding Principles
1. Safety before performance
2. Reproducibility before optimization
3. Transparency over proprietary shortcuts
4. Incremental validation (bench → subsystem → integrated engine)
5. Ethical boundary enforcement (see `ETHICS.md`)
