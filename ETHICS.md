# Ethics & Responsible Use – Redmoon 40KGF Turbojet Project

This document defines the ethical framework governing use, modification, and distribution of the Redmoon 40KGF open source turbojet engine model and associated artifacts (design files, analyses, test data, documentation, and tooling).

## 1. Scope
Applies to: all contributors, users, integrators, educators, and downstream redistributors. Covers digital assets, physical builds, test operations, and derivative works.

## 2. Foundational Principles
| Principle | Intent |
|-----------|-------|
| Peaceful Purpose | Only for educational, research, scientific, and constructive innovation. |
| Safety First | Protect people, property, and environment during design, testing, and operation. |
| Transparency | Share assumptions, limitations, and uncertainties. |
| Accountability | Own the impacts of adaptations and deployments. |
| Stewardship | Prevent misuse and reduce ecological footprint. |
| Integrity | Do not falsify data, results, or provenance. |

## 3. Permitted Uses (Examples)
| Category | Examples (Non‑Exhaustive) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Education | Academic labs, coursework, student propulsion clubs |
| Research | Combustion efficiency studies, materials evaluation, control algorithm prototyping |
| Open Innovation | Alternative fuels exploration, emission reduction experiments |
| Hobby / Learning | Personal bench tests with proper safety controls |
| Simulation & Modeling | CFD, FEA, control tuning, digital twin experimentation |

All permitted uses require adherence to safety, legal compliance, and attribution under the LICENSE.

## 4. Prohibited Uses (Strict)
The project, in whole or part, must NOT be used for:
- Weaponization or integration into offensive military systems
- Delivery platforms for harmful payloads or surveillance violating privacy/human rights
- Autonomous targeting or enforcement systems
- Activities banned by export control, sanctions, or local law
- Reckless public demonstrations without safety perimeters
- Environmental harm (intentional pollution, wildlife disturbance)

If in doubt, seek written clarification before proceeding.

## 5. Conditional / Sensitive Areas
These require heightened justification, documentation, and review:
| Area | Additional Expectation |
|------|-----------------------|
| High-Thrust Scaling | Structural & containment assessment required |
| Unmanned Aircraft Integration | Airspace regulatory compliance evidence |
| Alternative Fuels | Emission & material compatibility analysis |
| Closed/Indoor Testing | Ventilation, fire suppression, exhaust monitoring |
| Data Publication | Remove export‑controlled or proprietary third‑party data |

## 6. Environmental Responsibility
| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| Fuel Handling | Avoid spills; store per MSDS; use secondary containment |
| Noise | Respect local ordinances; use acoustic shielding where feasible |
| Emissions | Explore cleaner fuels; document emission metrics when possible |
| Waste | Recycle metal offcuts; dispose of lubricants per regulation |

## 7. Safety Safeguards (Minimums)
| Domain | Minimum Safeguard |
|--------|------------------|
| Test Cell | Rigid mount, debris shielding, controlled access perimeter |
| Personal PPE | Eye, hearing, heat protection, gloves during fueling |
| Fire Control | Class B fire extinguisher + spill kit within reach |
| Instrumentation | RPM, EGT, fuel flow, thrust (or load cell) for monitored tests |
| Shutdown | Quick fuel cut + starter disengage procedure documented |
| Data Logging | Time-stamped logs for anomaly review |

## 8. Data Integrity & Disclosure
Always:
- Distinguish between simulated vs empirical results
- Provide units, calibration notes, and method descriptions
- Report anomalies (overspeed, flameout, surge) truthfully
- Avoid selective omission of unfavorable data

## 9. Attribution & Derivatives
Derivative publications or modified designs must:
1. Retain copyright/license notices
2. Credit the Redmoon 40KGF Open Source Project
3. Clearly mark changed sections or geometry
4. Avoid implying official endorsement unless granted

## 10. Handling Potential Misuse
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| You observe questionable adaptation | Privately contact maintainers (see `CONTACTS.md`) |
| Clear violation (weaponization attempt) | Report immediately; do not publicly expose sensitive operational details |
| Legal uncertainty | Pause activity; request guidance with jurisdiction details |

## 11. Reporting Procedure
Include in a confidential message:
- Summary of concern
- Evidence (links, screenshots, commit hashes)
- Potential impact
- Your contact (optional – anonymous acceptable if credible)

## 12. Enforcement & Responses
Possible actions (graduated): clarify → warn → restrict participation → revoke contribution privileges → publicly document violation (if needed). Severe unethical conduct may trigger disclosure to appropriate authorities consistent with law.

## 13. Interaction with Other Policies
| Policy | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Behavioral norms; ethics extends to usage domains |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Process; ethics overlays restrictions on acceptable content |
| `COMMUNITY.md` | Governance; ethics informs decision escalation |
| LICENSE | Legal permission; ethics sets moral boundaries beyond license scope |

## 14. Export & Regulatory Compliance
Users are responsible for compliance with: export control (e.g., EAR/ITAR equivalents), aviation rules, local noise/emissions regulations. Do not submit controlled technical data (e.g., sensitive military performance envelopes).

## 15. Gray Areas & Advisory Requests
When unsure, open an Issue labeled `ethics-review` (minimal technical specifics) or email maintainers. Operating in ambiguity without review is discouraged.

## 16. Continuous Improvement
Propose amendments via PR labeled `ethics`. Provide justification, risk assessment, and stakeholder impact. Changes require maintainer consensus.

## 17. Affirmation
Usage or contribution implies acceptance of these ethical obligations. Those unwilling to comply should refrain from using or distributing the project.
