# 40KG Turbojet Engine – Quick Manual

## ⚠️ Safety First
- Turbines are **inherently dangerous**. Operate only if you have prior turbine knowledge.  
- Keep **bystanders 10m (30ft)** away.  
- Always have **CO₂ and Class ABC extinguishers** on hand.  
- Wear **ear protection**; exhaust gases reach **~1000°C**.  
- Turbine oil is toxic and carcinogenic – avoid contact and fumes.  
- Use a **qualified ground assistant** during startup.  

## 🔧 Warranty
- **1-Year Warranty**: Covers all parts except batteries.  
- **Lifetime Coverage**: Combustion chamber, shaft, tunnel, diffuser, injectors, NGV, turbine wheel.  
- **Exclusions**:  
  - Crash or FOD damage  
  - Glow plug, starter, pump, ECU, GSU  
  - Improper storage or electrical connections  
  - Use of non-approved oils (e.g., 2-cycle oil)  

## ⛽ Fuel & Oil
- Mix ratio:  
  - **3% oil with diesel** OR  
  - **5% oil with kerosene/JetA**  
- Only use approved turbine oil.  
- Using non-approved oils **voids warranty**.  

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Mount engine on a **test stand** before aircraft installation.  
2. Connections:  
   - ECU → Motor (MR30 cable)  
   - ECU → Power (XT30/XT60 to 3S LiPo)  
   - ECU → Pump & GSU  
   - ECU → Receiver throttle (PPM)  
3. Secure all fuel tubing with **20-gauge stainless wire**.  
4. **Check polarity carefully** – reversing LiPo destroys ECU instantly.  

## 🚀 Operation

### Startup
1. Open fuel valve.  
2. Power receiver → ECU syncs (audible tone).  
3. **Prime fuel lines** with GSU test pump.  
4. Power on transmitter.  
5. Raise trim → ECU status = “Ready”.  
6. Full throttle → back to idle → start sequence begins:  
   - Ignition  
   - Preheat  
   - Fuel ramp  
7. On first run, ECU will **auto-train** throttle range.  

### Shutdown
1. Lower stick & trim to minimum.  
2. ECU initiates **cool down cycle** (starter runs until safe temp).  
3. Shut off fuel → ECU → radio.  

## 🧩 Accessories
Key service parts include:  
- Inlet runner  
- Diffuser  
- Billet wheel  
- Turbine shaft / wheel  
- NGV + evaporator  
- Combustion chamber  
- Starter connector  

## 📌 Notes
- Always **test run before mounting in aircraft**.  
- ECU features: **auto-start, auto-restart, data logging, thrust curve control**.  
- If unsure: **do not run the engine**.
