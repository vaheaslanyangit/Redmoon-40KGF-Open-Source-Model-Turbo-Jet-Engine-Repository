# CAD Files Introduction

Welcome to the CAD documentation for the Redmoon 40KGF Open Source Model Turbo Jet Engine project. This section introduces the available CAD files and sketches used in the design and development of the engine components.

## Contents

- Overview of CAD sketches
- File structure and naming conventions
- How to access and use the CAD files

## Overview

The CAD files provided here include detailed sketches and models for each major component of the turbo jet engine. These files are intended to assist with visualization, fabrication, and further development.

## File Structure

- `/Sketches/` — Contains individual part sketches in standard CAD formats (e.g., .STEP, .DXF, .SLDPRT).
- `/Assemblies/` — Includes assembly files showing how parts fit together.
- `/Drawings/` — Engineering drawings for manufacturing and reference.

## Usage

To view or edit the CAD files, use compatible software such as SolidWorks, Fusion 360, or FreeCAD. Refer to the README in each subfolder for specific instructions.

## Contribution
