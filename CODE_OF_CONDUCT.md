# Code of Conduct – Redmoon 40KGF Open Source Turbojet Project

This repository represents a collaborative effort to advance open, ethical, and responsible aero‑propulsion technology. By participating, you agree to uphold the spirit of mutual respect, integrity, safety, and legal compliance described here.

## Core Principles
1. Respect the Project: Treat this codebase, its documentation, designs, and contributors with care. Deliberate damage, misinformation, or sabotage is unacceptable.
2. Treat Others Well: Interact with others as you would like to be treated—kindly, constructively, and patiently.
3. Tell the Truth: Be honest about test data, limitations, failures, and safety concerns. Fabricated or obscured results erode trust.
4. Ethical Use First: Use all designs only for peaceful, educational, research, and constructive innovation purposes. See `ETHICS.md` for full guidance.
5. Contribute Responsibly: Submit improvements that are clear, documented, and tested where feasible. Low‑effort or spam contributions may be declined.
6. Follow the Law: All use and contributions must comply with applicable local, national, and international laws, including export controls and safety regulations.
7. Protect Safety: Flag potential hazards, misuse risks, or design concerns early. Safety feedback is always welcome.

## Expected Behaviors
- Be inclusive: Welcome newcomers; explain context instead of dismissing questions.
- Be precise: Provide clear reproduction steps, test configurations, and version info.
- Be accountable: Correct mistakes openly; retract or amend inaccurate claims.
- Be collaborative: Prefer improvement over criticism; propose solutions.
- Credit fairly: Acknowledge prior work and cite sources for borrowed concepts.

## Unacceptable Behaviors
- Harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, or derogatory language.
- Encouraging or enabling weaponization, unlawful surveillance, or harmful deployment.
- Knowingly sharing unsafe, misleading, or falsified technical data.
- Persistent off-topic promotion, spam, or disruptive behavior.
- Attempting to bypass safety, ethical, or legal safeguards.

## Ethical Use Reminder
This project is NOT for:
- Weapon development or hostile use.
- Violating privacy, airspace regulations, or ecological protections.
- Any activity causing harm to people, infrastructure, or ecosystems.
See `ETHICS.md` for expanded scenarios and reporting channels.

## Contribution Guidelines (Summary)
1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before opening a pull request.
2. Open an Issue for significant design changes first.
3. Follow existing file structure and naming conventions.
4. Include rationale, references, and test/analysis evidence when modifying critical components.
5. Mark safety-impacting changes clearly.
6. Avoid adding proprietary or unlicensed third-party content.

## Reporting Issues
If you witness behavior that violates this Code:
- Open a private Issue (if permitted) or use designated project contact channels.
- Provide factual details (who, what, where, when). Avoid speculation.
- Safety or ethics concerns receive priority review.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may: warn, request revisions, temporarily restrict participation, or ban accounts for violations. Severe or repeated violations—especially involving safety, legality, or harassment—may result in permanent removal and public clarification.

## Legal & Compliance Notice
You are responsible for ensuring compliance with:
- Export controls and dual-use regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.
- Aviation, unmanned systems, and propulsion testing regulations.
- Environmental and emissions standards where relevant.
Do not contribute content that would unlawfully transfer controlled technical data.

## Attribution & Integrity
Always preserve original authorship metadata in commit history where possible. Do not misrepresent authorship, test results, or provenance of designs.

## Continuous Improvement
This Code will evolve. Propose refinements via pull request with clear justification. Version changes are logged in repository history.

## Affirmation
Participation indicates your agreement to act with honesty, respect, responsibility, and commitment to ethical, lawful use of this technology.
